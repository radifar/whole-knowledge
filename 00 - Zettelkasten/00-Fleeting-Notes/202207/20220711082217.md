# Cookiecutter-CMS for Python Package beginner

Cookiecutter-CMS lack many features, and it is hard to suggest new changes because they have to be:
1. Robust
2. Benefit really outweight risk/disadvantage

Maybe the core developer afraid things will break and try to keep it at bare minimum rather than include new features.

In some way I agree with this approach because it is mainly used for scientific software engineer who trying to start develop new Python package. And also, for MOLSSI education.

Bare minimum necessity, all we have to do is prioritize and decide which one is bare minimum.
