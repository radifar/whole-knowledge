title: Lets create skill quadrant!
---

I think it would be awesome if I could somehow create quadrant, where x axis will be how useful is it to me, and y would be how difficult it is. And the size of the dot will reflect my confident of using that skill.

This way I can see better of my skill and can prioritize what to learn next.
