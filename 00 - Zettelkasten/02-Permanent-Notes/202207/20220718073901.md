# Modern Day Zettelkasten - Or how to level up your note-taking skills

Disclaimer: This is not an expert opinion on Zettelkasten. Rather, this is merely my brain dump on Zettelkasten. I just recently learn Zettelkasten and writing about this could help me understand what Zettelkasten is, how it evolve in current digital age, how I choose my tool and how all of these shape my workflow.

## Where it all started

For so long I have been looking for a simplistic note-taking tool, from Evernote, Sublime, Notion, and so on. I can see that there are many things to consider and then as time passes by my preferences started to converge.

First, lets talk about pain points. I definitely annoyed by the fact that opening the tool is either 1) take too long, or/and 2) too many steps to open and create new note. I also dislike it when creating a simple note is such hazzle like when using Notion.

Second, lets talk about where the trend goes, as the trend goes my mind is more and more subconsciously gravitated towards them. One of the trend in note-taking is markdown. We can see that in the past decade Markdown became increasingly popular, despite of some critiques among Documentarian. We can see that Markdown is being used to describe a software or library, used in documentation, JAMstack (e.g. Hugo, Jekyll), andâ€¦ note-taking of course.
