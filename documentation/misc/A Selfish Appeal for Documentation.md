Writing code is the act of building a mental model of a problem, and then translating that model into executable software.

Writing documentation about software is the act of serializing this mental state. **You can think about documentation as JSON for your mental state while programming.** Documentation allows you to dump the information in your brain, in a format that allows others to reload into theirs.

Reading source code is the most inefficient way of transferring mental state. It also only conveys information on _what_ the code does, not _why_ it does it. My favorite rule around code comments fits well here:

> Document the why, not the how

By writing documentation, you are able to load the _why_ of your code into someone elses brain. Or reload it back into your brain 6 months after you wrote it. This allows you to complete your job faster, and also stops you from making the same mistakes over again.

Do yourself a favor and write documentation for your software.
