# My Workflow

Based on [My Workflow](https://fossacademic.tech/2020/12/27/Workflow.html) by Robert W. Gehl (27 Dec 2020)

## Workspaces

I use KDE Spin of Fedora 36 (2022). Currently it uses Plasma 5.25. I'm currently using 4 virtual desktop:
1. Main task: Writing and reading references
2. Pomodoro + additional/auxiliary task, eg. secondary reference view, file explorer
3. Entertainment
4. Misc

## Note-taking

For note taking I'm using Zettlr, previously I'm using Obsidian but I found that the look of Zettlr much better. I also don't feel like I'm gonna need the Obsidian graph feature. I also like how Zettlr can use multiple workspace/project. Moreover a few moment from now there will be a feature where I can split the editor into multiple view, which is nice.

## Pomodoro

Use gnome-pomodoro, installed via `sudo dnf install gnome-pomodoro`
Using default 25-5 x 3 + 25-15.
