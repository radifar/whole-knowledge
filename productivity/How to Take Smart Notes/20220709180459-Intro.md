Writing purpose:
1. To remember
2. Organize our thought
3. Exchange idea

- Writing plays such a central role in learning, studying and research
- Writing didn't start from blank screen or sheet of paper. It start from note-taking, this is the main part that commonly ignored.
- Improving writing organisation makes a difference, writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development.
- This book showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way.

- Writing **is not** what follows research, learning or studying, it is the **medium** of all this work. And maybe this is the reason why we rarely think about this writing, the everyday writing, the note-taking and draft-making.
- Another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don't experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly.
