Imagine some well-paid personal assistant prepared a rough draft of your paper for you. It is already a fully developed argument including all references, quotes and some really smart ideas. The only thing left to do is to revise this rough draft and send it off.

Imagine now you are not the one who has to edit the rough draft and turn it into the final paper, but the one who has to prepare it. What would be helpful to achieve that quickly? It would certainly make things a lot easier if you already had everything you need right in front of you: The ideas, the arguments, the quotes, long developed passages, complete with bibliography and references.

You don't need to wait for a personal assistant to appear, as each step is clearly not only within your abilities, but also straightforward and well defined: Assemble notes and bring them into order, turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done.

Writing these notes is the main work. It will take enormous amounts of effort, time, patience and willpower, and you will probably break under the weight of this taks. JUST KIDDING. It is the easiest part of all. Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is.
- The notes are just the tangible outcome of it.
- Writing notes accompanies the main work and, done right, it helps with it.
- Writing is, without dispute the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have.
- Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway.
- If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down.
- If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words.
- Thinking takes places as much on paper as in your own head.

> No matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding (Neil Levy, 2011)

- The experts agree: You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write. If you write, it is more likely that you understand what you read, remember what you learn and that our thoughts make sense. And if we have to write anyway, why not use our writing to build up the resources for our future publications?

# Writing a paper step by step
1. **Fleeting Notes**.
  Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. Don't worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on. These are fleeting notes, **mere reminders of what is in your head**. Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later. Fleeting notes can be:
  - simple notebook, or
  - voice record on phone
  if your thoughts are already sorted and you have the time, you can skip this step and write your idea directly down as a proper, permanent note for your slip-box.

2. **Literature Notes**.
  Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don't want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing.
  - Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words.
  - Be extra selective with quotes – don't copy them to skip the step of really understanding what they mean.
  - Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place – your reference system.

3. **Permanent Notes**.
  Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (**ideally once a day** and **before you forget what you meant**) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests.
- The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions.
- Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box on your mind)?
- Can you combine ideas to generate something new?
- What questions are triggered by them?

Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for some else:
- Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible.
- **Throw away the fleeting notes** from step one and **put the literature notes from step two into your reference system**. You can forget about them now. All that matters is going into the slip-box.

4. **How to add permanent notes to the slip-box**
- Filling each one behind one or more related notes (with a program, you can put one note "behind" multiple notes). **Look to which note the new one directly relates** or, if it does not relate directly to any other note yet, **just file it behind the last one**.
- Adding links to related notes.
- Making sure you will be able to find this note later by either **linking to it from your index** or by **making a link to it on a note that you use as an entry point to a discussion or topic** and is itself **linked to the index**.

5. **Develop topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system.**
- Read more → evolve your argument according to new information
- Take more notes → develop ideas further and see where things will take you.
- Just follow your interest and always take the path that promises the most insight.
- Even if you don't have anything in your slip-box yet, you never start from scratch – you already have ideas on your mind to be tested, opinions to be challenged and questions to be answered.
- Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters.
- Don't cling to an idea if **another, more promising one gains momentum.** The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it. It might be exactly what you were interested in from the beginning, but it is more likely that your interests will have changed – that is what insight does.

6. **Look for what is missing and what is redundant.**
  After a while --> you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about.
  Your topic is now based on **what you have**, **not based on unfounded idea** about what the literature you are **about to read might provide**.
  - Look through the connections → collect all relevant notes on this topic → copy and bring them in order → what is missing? what is redundant? → try ideas out and give yourself enough time to go back to reading and note-taking → improve ideas, arguments and their structure.

7. **Turn notes into rough draft.**
  - copy then translate them into something coherent
  - embed them into the context of your argument while you build your argument out of the notes
  - Detect holes in your argument, fill them or change your argument.

8. **Edit and proofread manuscript.**

These steps are for one paper/article at a time, in reality, you never work with just one idea, but **many ideas in different stages at the same time**!
That is where this system really shine.
- Gather what you encounter along your way and don't let any good idea to go to waste.
- We constantly encounter interesting ideas along the way and only a fraction of them are useful for the particular paper we started reading it for. Why let them go to waste? → Make a note and add it to your slip-box.
- Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass that turns a mere collection of ideas into an idea-generator.
- We might focus on one idea for a while, but then leave it alone for another while until they see how to proceed further. → It is helpful then to be able to pick up on another idea now and go back to the earlier thought later. **It is much more realistic to keep this flexibility and you don't have to worry about starting all over**.
