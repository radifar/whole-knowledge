- One of the most powerful tool for self development.

## What is Zettelkasten?- [0:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2zY7l2tzoQ&t=52s)
- Personal Knowledge Management
- Train you by writing and thinking critically
- I only do what is easy. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else (Niklas Luhmann)

## How it works- [1:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2zY7l2tzoQ&t=99s)
- Components - Organization - Process

## Notes Types- [2:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2zY7l2tzoQ&t=125s)
- 4 Notes
    - Core components:
        1. Literature
            Took brief note when reading. His reaction when he read, and anything he didn't want to forget.
        2. Permanent
            Ideas and insights that come from literature note. Important: Unique ID, high quality note, link to other note.
    - Auxiliary components:
        3. Hub
            Entry point, index, topics/sub topics, keywords
        4. Fleeting
            Random thoughts, intended for later processing, not keep permanently.

## Notes Organization- [4:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2zY7l2tzoQ&t=265s)
Literature â†’ goes to â†’ Reference box / directory
Permanent â†’ goes to â†’ Main box / directory
Hub â†’ entry points to pemanent notes
    - Sorting, and
    - Linking in a meaningful ways

- related notes clustered together, and usually use branch id.

## Luhmann's process- [5:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2zY7l2tzoQ&t=342s)
Above is the system, but what is more important is the daily routine!
READ - WRITE -REVIEW - RELATE - CREATE

## Why Zettelkasten works! - [7:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2zY7l2tzoQ&t=420s)
1. Standardized format
    Make thing as simple as possible, therefore distraction free and allow thinking more clearly
2. Write to think
    Test your understanding of an idea, related to Feynmann technique
3. Friendly to your brain
    See connection better. This is the core property of Zettelkasten
4. High quality encoding
    help process information effectively

## Comment

Hi Darin, this is wonderful! I'm Radif from Indonesia and just recently learn about Zettelkasten.  
  
Your video explain the Zettelkasten in a very detailed yet simple way, so thanks and I subscribe to your channel immediately. Anyway, currently I'm interested how to apply Zettelkasten in a digital way. I am interested in these questions:

1\. How Luhmann will use Zettelkasten if he live in current days?

2\. There is some argument over chaining notes where you spread lots of idea into several notes due to limited writing space. Some said that this is not necessary in digital format as your note is very flexible. The problem with this is the note atomicity, do we really need to make the note as atomic as possible or spread them into several notes? Currently I prefer putting whatever comes to mind in a single topic into single note, for practical reason. I think it is easier to manage too.

3\. Do we need to regularly purge unneeded fleeting notes? Seems like a hassle to me, and sometime I think that they are being done because the box limitation. But with the availability of search engine inside our tool and unlimited space, this task is no longer relevant.

4\. Do hub notes really relevant in digital Zettelkasten? I mean there is already tagging, category, and search engine. Some tools (e.g. Obsidian) even provide graph to show topic connection and clustering.

5\. Overall, how Zettelkasten could evolve in this digital age. I am sure that as there are many style in applying Zettelkasten, some could miss what Luhmann has intended and thus making it less effective. And some other could aid the original one and making it more effective. I am sure that given the simplistic nature of this technique, there are still room for improvement. Anyhow, whichever the style is, as you said in the video the most important think is the process or the daily routine.

 
I hope that you can answer these question in your next video. Once again thanks a lot! ðŸ˜ƒ
