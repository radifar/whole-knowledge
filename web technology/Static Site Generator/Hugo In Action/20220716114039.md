# Part I - Chapter 2 - Live in 30 minutes: You now have a website


## Your first Hugo website

1. Hugo command line
    `hugo --help`
    `hugo new site acme-coorperation --format yaml`
    
    YAML is more prevalent in programming community, less verbose than TOML, and better supported by GitHub.
    It is easier language to get started with
2. Adding to source control
    `cd acme-corporation`
    `git init .`
    `git add *`
    `git commit -m "Create website skeleton"`
3. Structure of the Hugo source folder
    - **archetypes**
        contains the templates for the content files.
    - **content**
    - **data**
        stores structured content in the form of YAML, TOML, CSV, or JSON
    - **layouts**
        overrides part of the theme (AKA theme customization)
    - **themes**
        the code that we use to make the content in the `content` folder presentable
    - **config**
        - Hugo supports splitting config file into multiple files and having different env for testing and production
        - That multiple config file stored inside this folder
    - **static**
        - store static content lke fonts or PDF files.
        - somewhat equivalent to Apache/Nginx web server root folder.
        - It is advisable to put as much content as possible in the content, data, themes, and layouts folders to have programmatic access to it and benefit from Hugo's render pipeline.
    
    
## Adding a theme
- For a website to come to life, there are two essential component needed: Theme and Content.
- A theme in Hugo represents **all the logic** that converts markup documents into presentable web pages.
